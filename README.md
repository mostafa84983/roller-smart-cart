# 🚀 Team Branching Guidelines

## 🔴 DO NOT PUSH DIRECTLY TO `main` OR `dev` 🚫
All code changes must go through **`feature`** branches and be merged into **`base`**.

---

## 📂 Branching Structure
We follow a structured branching strategy to organize our work across teams.

### 🌳 **Main Branches**
- `main` – **Stable, production-ready code**. 🔒 Protected.
- `dev` – **Integration branch for testing before merging into `main`**. 🔒 Protected.

### 🛠 **`base` Branches**

#### 🛠 **Web Team `base` Branches**
The web team has specific `base` branches for different parts of the application:
- **`web-backend-main`** – Backend development
- **`web-front-global-main`** – Global frontend components
- **`web-front-cart-main`** – Cart-specific frontend components

Feature branches should be created under the relevant `base` branch (without the `-main` suffix):
```
web-backend/authentication
web-backend/order-processing
web-front-global/navbar-ui
web-front-cart/cart-ui
```

#### 🛠 **Other Team `base` Branches**
- **`devops-main`** – DevOps (CI/CD, Infrastructure, Automation)
- **`ml-main`** – Machine Learning (Models, Training, Inference)
- **`embedded-main`** – Embedded (Raspberry Pi, Sensors, Hardware)

Feature branches should be created under the relevant `base` branch (without the `-main` suffix):
```
devops/aws-setup
devops/ci-pipeline
ml/training-v2
ml/object-detection
embedded/raspberry-pi-setup
embedded/sensor-integration
```

## 📜 Workflow Rules

1️⃣ **Ensure you are on the appropriate `base` branch before creating a feature branch:**
```sh
git fetch origin # Fetch latest remote branches
git checkout web-backend-main # Switch to base branch
git pull origin web-backend-main # Get latest code from base
```

2️⃣ **Create a feature branch from the `base` branch:**
```sh
git checkout -b web-backend/authentication # Creates a local branch
git push -u origin web-backend/authentication # Creates a remote branch and tracks it (links it with the local one)
```
⭕ **If the branch already exists remotely, switch to it using:**
```sh
git switch --track origin/web-backend/authentication # Creates a local branch based in the remote branch and tracks the remote
```
⭕ **To ensure your local branch is linked to the remote:**
```
git branch -vv
```
**You should see something like:**
```
* web-backend/authentication  ba876d7 [origin/web-backend/authentication] Latest commit message
```
3️⃣ **Work on your changes and commit regularly.**
```sh
git pull
git add .
git commit -m "Implemented authentication API"
```
**When ready to push:**
```sh
git push
```
4️⃣ **Once tested and stable, merge to the `base` branch.**
```sh
git pull
git checkout web-backend-main # Switch to base
git merge web-backend/authentication # Merge feature into base
git push origin web-backend-main # Push to remote
```

5️⃣ **Delete the merged feature branch:**
```sh
git branch -d web-backend/authentication  # Delete locally
git push origin --delete web-backend/authentication  # Delete remotely
```

6️⃣ **At the integration phase, we will merge all `base` branches (`web-backend-main`, `web-front-global-main`, `web-front-cart-main`, `devops-main`, `ml-main`, and `embedded-main`) into `dev`.**

7️⃣ **Ready code will be merged for production `dev` → `main`.**
- Code ready for deployment and agreed upon from all team members will be merged to `main`.

## 🔒 Rules & Best Practices

✅ **Always use feature branches.**  
✅ **Follow naming conventions (`base/feature-name`).**  
✅ **Pull before committing or pushing**  
✅ **Ensure your changes are tested before merging.**  
✅ **Merge feature branches into `base` branches *not* `dev`.**  
✅ **Delete old branches after merging with your `base`.**  

❌ **DO NOT push directly to `main` or `dev`.**  
❌ **DO NOT merge to `dev` or `main` without team agreement.**  
❌ **DO NOT leave stale branches unmerged.**
